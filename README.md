# parallel_neural_network
C implementation of a neural network using OpenMP and CUDA for parallelization.

This project was developed as a part of the course *Architecture and Platforms for Artificial Intelligence (Mod. 2) - Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna*.

The [report](https://github.com/Lostefra/parallel_neural_network/blob/main/report.pdf) provides an in-depth analysis of the parallelization techniques employed and a description of the [OpenMP](https://github.com/Lostefra/parallel_neural_network/blob/main/omp/neural_network_omp.c) and [CUDA](https://github.com/Lostefra/parallel_neural_network/blob/main/cuda/neural_network_cuda.cu) programs.
